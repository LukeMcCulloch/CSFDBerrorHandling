Improved error reporting for the CSF




The current CSF Error reporting is generic. Here is the error message shown to the user in MOSES Executive,

           *** WARNING: Export to Common Solution File Unsuccessful 

The idea of this feature is to improve the reporting so that the user gets to have a better understanding on which step the error has occurred. There are debug logs that point to the error in which step the error has occurred. 

The idea is to send the error message from the C++ interface to FORTRAN so that the error can be displayed properly rather than a generic Warning to the user in MOSES Executive.

For this error logs from the following functions need to be reported back and combined


    csf_write_to_db -- Creates the CSF files: CSF db, CSF output file and SACS model file
    csf_run_post  -- Perform the POST analysis and create postvue database
    csf_run_fatigue  -- Runs fatigue
    csf_run_jointcan -- Perform the JOINT CAN analysis
    csf_run_jointcan_iso  -- Perform the JOINT CAN analysis for ISO codes
    csf_write_jointcan_cards  -- Writes the Joint Can cards to the CSF db




// debug log is not logging during release


// error messages for the dev exist but need to be passed back
// error messages for the user do not exist yet it seems
